1. A nested list is a list that appears as an element in another list.
Example: [[1,2],2,3,5]
2. Yes , we can have both interger and string in a list


Ex 11.1:
list(range(10,0,-2))
>>>[10,8,6,4,2]
if start < stop  and step < 0 the list return list without values
Ex: list(range(0,10,-1))
>>> []
Rule: 
- step need to have the same sign with (stop – start).If not, IDLE return []
- they need to be intergers
ex: list(range(0,10,1.5))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
    list(range(10,0,1.5))
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
Ex 11.2:
This fragment just create one instance. Because Python'll understand that alex is a variable assign to tess. alex isn't an another turtle. If we change properties of the variable, we also change the properties of the turtle tess that assigned to it. So the color of tess also change.
